# Ocha No Pozu

Ocha No P≈çzu (Tea Pose) is a game about a samurai warrior who fights monsters and eventually a final boss.  It is a 2D Platformer with a 32 bit artstyle written completely in Python with use of the PyGame library.  The world is procedurally generated to allow for maximum replayability.

This game is not intended as a full indie release, but rather as a small project.

## Special Note
Firstly, this game is unfinished and may never be finished.

This game was made in the *Programming for Video Games* Course at Duke TIP.  Unfortunately, our instructor was sub-par to say the least so this is my best attempt at making a game with knowledge I already had.  Artwork was made by Jeongwoo Choi and Brandon Braswell.

This game is a little buggy and fairly lagging mainly due to flaws in the underlying PyGame library such as a lack of GPU Acceleration.  However, some of it is most definitely lazy coding on my end.
